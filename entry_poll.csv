How will you use Stata from 03/26/2024-05/17/2024?,What operating system will you use locally or remotely?,"Do you have any experience using Stata, SAS, R, Python, or any other statistical software?"
Locally on my laptop,MacOSX,"Competent User. I am proficient in using Stata, SAS, R, Python, etc. for data exploration, descriptive statistics, basic inference (t-tests, chi-square tests), and regression"
Remotely on another desktop or terminal,Windows,Basic Knowledge. I have a general understanding of basic commands but I require asistance to perform tasks.
